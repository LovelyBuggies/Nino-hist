Introduction
------------

`Hist <https://github.com/scikit-hep/hist>`_ is a powerful Histogramming tool for analysis based on `boost-histogram <https://boost-histogram.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ (the binding of the Histogram library in Boost). It is a friendly analysis-focused project that uses `boost-histogram <https://boost-histogram.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ as a backend to do the work, but provides plotting tools, shortcuts, and new ideas. Nino-Hist is the warm up project for `hist <https://github.com/scikit-hep/hist>`_, which aims to provide functional supports and add new features for `hist <https://github.com/scikit-hep/hist>`_. It is written in the Python programming language and is available on almost all platforms.
